## Wedding Website

Visit at vander-wiel.com.

### Task
The goal of this project was to make a functional wedding website that catered to the needs of our guests. We needed a mostly static site that showed relevant information along with a RSVP form for guests to fill out to note if they were able to make it to the wedding.

### Technology
For this project I used Next.js connected to MongoDB. For styling I used styled-components that allowed me to create components on the fly to match my styling needs. 

I also used Figma to pre-design elements of the site before hand. 

The site should dynamically work for web and mobile. 

### What I learned
This project was an interesting personal project as it had its own set of requirements and deadlines to hit. This not only helped motiviate me to create a great experience for the guests of our wedding but also helped to emulate a "real world" environment.
